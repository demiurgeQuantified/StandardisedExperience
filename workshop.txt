title=Standardised Experience
description=This mod is an updated version of Conqueror Koala's Standardized XP series for B41 multiplayer.
description=
description=Standardised Aiming XP: Removes the vanilla aiming XP nerf after level 4
description=Standardised Reloading XP: Removes the vanilla reloading XP nerf after level 4, and has options to make reloading XP less random (or more)
description=Standardised Sprinting XP: You will gain a set amount of XP every 15 seconds while sprinting, in addition to the vanilla slow and random XP
description=Standardised Nimble XP: You will gain a set amount of XP every 10 seconds while in combat stance, in addition to the vanilla slow and random XP
description=Standardised Passive XP: Allows you to configure the rate of XP given to the passive skills (fitness and strength) by every method other than exercise (There are plenty of other mods that change exercise XP rates)

description=Generally, this mod will allow characters who don't start with points in skills such as sprinting and nimble to still be able to gain some levels in them, and characters that do will be able to get much further than in vanilla. It also makes it possible for characters who don't start with a point in aiming to eventually be able to use rifles.
description=
description=Features can be toggled and configured using sandbox variables - you can grant xp multipliers to specific skills as well as many mod-specific options.
description=The entire series (Standardized Aiming, Standardized Reloading, Standardized Nimble, Standardized Sprinting, Standardized Passive) are included in one mod. If you only want to use some of them, you can disable the others with sandbox variables.
description=
description=This mod works on old saves, but if you're playing singleplayer you'll need another mod to change the sandbox settings. Sandbox settings are not applied immediately - return to the main menu and load after changing them, or restart your server.
